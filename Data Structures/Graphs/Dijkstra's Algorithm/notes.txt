Dijkstra's Algorithm:
Single Source Shortest Path (SSSP) algorithm fr graphs with non-negative edge weights

Depending on how the algorithm is implemented and what data structures are used the time complexity is typically
O(e * log(v)) which is competitive against

This constraint (that there can only be non-negative edge weights) is so that Dijkstra can work in a greedy manner by
always selecting the next most promising node.

Works with directed and undirected graphs.

Quick Algorithm Overview:

Create a distance array where the distance to every node is positive infinity. Mark the distant to the
start node 's' to be 0. (The start node is 0 distance away from itself).

Maintain a priority-queue pairs of nodex index to distance.
