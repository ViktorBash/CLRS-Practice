"""
Merge sort in python
Merge sort breaks a list into smaller lists, sorts the smaller lists and joins them back together.
As we merge back, we sort the lists until we get back to one list.

MergeSort is recursive and a divide-and-conquer algorithm
It is very efficient for large data sets.

Big O notation: O(n log n) because each merge step doubles the list size
