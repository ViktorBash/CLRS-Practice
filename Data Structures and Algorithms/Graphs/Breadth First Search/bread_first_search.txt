Breadth first search is a graph traversal algorithm
Finds every vertex that is reachable from a source vertex, and finds the distance from the source (number of edges)
Works on directed/undirected graphs
Runs in O(V+E) time, V is vertices E is edges
Building block for other algorithms.

BFS: useful for finding the shortest path on an unweighted  graph.
Explores the neighbors of a node first before it goes farther. It explores nodes in layers. It maintains a queue of
which node it should visit next.
