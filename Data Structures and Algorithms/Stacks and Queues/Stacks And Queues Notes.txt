Stacks and Queues in Python Notes

Both:
Very similar, linear data structures (like an array)
We have nodes like a linked list


Stack:
Last In, First Out.
Is like a stack of plates, the last one put into the stack is the first one to take out.


Queue:
First in First out
Like a queue in real life. It's a line with elements waiting.

We add things to the tail and remove from the head.
