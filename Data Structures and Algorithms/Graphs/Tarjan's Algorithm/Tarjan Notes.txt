Tarjan's Algorithm finds strongly connected components (SCC)

What are SCC:
SCC's are thought of as self-contained cycles in a directed graph where every vertex in the cycle can reach every other
vertex in the same cycle.

Low-link value:
Value of the smallest node ID reachable from a node when doing DFS. (aka, when given a node, it is the value of the
lowest ID node that can be reached from that node). This uses DFS
