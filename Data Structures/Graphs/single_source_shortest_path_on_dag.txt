Single Source Shortest Path (SSSP) on a directed acyclic graph (DAG).

O(v+e) notation where v is vertices and e is edges. This is a linear runtime and very good (better than Dijkstra's
algorithm). Also allows negative weights and will still work.

How it works:
Uses topological sort (top-sort) on the DAG to create a list of the nodes.
After that we use a dictionary to key each node to the value from the starting node using the edge weights.
