BST: Each node has at most two children, with the entries being ordered.
The left child will be smaller than the parent, and the right child will be greater than the parent.

BST cannot have duplicates, (it breaks the rules of a right node being larger and a left node being smaller).

BST Time Complexity
Space: Average O(n), Worst Case O(n)
Search Average O(log n) Worst Case O(n)
Insert Average O(log n ) Worst Case O(n)
Delete Average O(log n) Worst Case O(n)

BST Property: definition of BST, every node on right is larger, every node on left is smaller
Basically, checking if a binary tree is a BST
