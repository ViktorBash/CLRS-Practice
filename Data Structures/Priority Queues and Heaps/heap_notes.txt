Heaps are a type of tree
There are 2 types of heaps

Rules Of Heaps:
Heaps can not have cycles, and some other rules.
It has to follow the ordering whether it is a minheap or maxheap.
Heaps don't have to be binary, one node can be connected to multiple nodes.
Heaps can have multiple heads/parts that are not connected at the top
two nodes cannot point to the same node though (not a tree, not a heap)
A heap can be just one node or even resemble a linked list.


Minheap and Maxheap:
Minheap: Elements are all smaller than their children, (the elements get bigger as you go down)
Insertion: 


Maxheap: inverse of minheap
