DFS Overview:
Most fundamental search algorithm used to explore nodes and edges of a graph. It runs with a time complexity of
O(v+e) and is often used as a building block in other algorithms.

It is not useful by itself, but is good when augmented with other stuff. Also, it is easy to learn and we need to know
it to move on to harder algorithms.

DFS: Plunges depth first into a graph without regard for which edge it takes until it can't go further and has to go
back.
Kind of like traversing our graph.
