Singly linked lists are the most basic with nodes, one head and one end node/tail.

Singly inked list:
Has nodes with two components, data and next. The data is just the data, and the next is the pointer to the next node.
There is a also a head and a tail. The next pointer of the last node in a linked list points to None.

Array vs Linked List:
Insertion/Deletion
Array: O(n), Linked List: O(1)

Access Element:
Array O(1), Linked List: O(n)

Contigous Memory: Array Yes, Linked List no

Linked Lists:
Insertion:
- Append element to the end
- Prepend element to the beginning (make it the new head)
- Insertion (insert after a node)

Deletion
- delete node with inputted data field, two cases: Node to be deleted is the head, or the node to be deleted is not the head
If the node to delete is the head: Make the next node the head
If the node to delete is not the head: Delete the node and change the pointer of the previous node
- delete node at a certain position
Two cases: when node is the head and when node is anything else except the head

Node Swap:
- Swap the places of two nodes
