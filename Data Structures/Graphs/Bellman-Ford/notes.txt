Bellman-Ford Algorithm:
More simpler algorithm but still can be hard.
Single source shortest path algorithm (SSSP). It can find the shortest path from one node to any other node.
It is not ideal because it has a time complexity of O(EV) instead of O((E+V)log(V)) like Dijkstra's algorithm using
a binary heap.
We use bellman ford's algorithm when Dijkstra's fails, like when a graph has negative edge weights.
Dijkstra's can't work with negative weights because it will go for infinity.

Example of Bellman-Ford:
Helps in finance when finding arbitrage between two or more markets.

Negative Cycle:
When there is a negative weight and the distance to some nodes can be negative infinity.

BF Algorithm Steps:
E is edges, v is vertices, s is starting node.
