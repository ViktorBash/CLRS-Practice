Priority Queue Notes

Priority queues are derived from heaps, (and heaps are derived from trees).
Technically though, priority queues are not heaps.

Where is a Priority Queue used:
used for Dijkstra's algorithm in some impementations
Anytime you need to dynamically fetch the next best or next worst element.
Used in Huffman coding (lossless data compression)
Used BFS algorithms such as A* to grab the next most promising node
Used by minimum spanning tree (MST) algorithms, (Prim's algorithm ex)

PQ implemented as a binary heap:
Construction: O(n)
Polling: O(log(n))  Removing element from the root of the heap
Peeking (1)  See the value at the top
Adding O(log(n)) We possible have to reshuffle the heap by bubbling up a value

Naive Removing: O(N)
